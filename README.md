# Erosion Monitoring App

This Android App was developed to enable citizen scientists to upload photos of sensitive sites to contribute to erosion monitoring at Navajo National Monument. User's are guided to six sites and asked to take photos of the river and surrounding  cliffs. These photos are uploaded to a cloud database and assembled into a time-series that gives park staff a unique perspective into erosion rates and processes in the canyon.

### User Interface

Users are provided with offline ready maps that include the location and description of six sites that are of interest to park staff. Example photos are also provided. The map may also be used to keep hikers from getting lost, as cell reception is not available along the route. 

### Database

Photos are stored in a cloud database provided by Microsoft Azure in BLOB format. 

### Development

The app was written in Java and utilizes Gradle and Maven repositories. Android Studio Code was the primary IDE.
